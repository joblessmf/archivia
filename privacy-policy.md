## 2. Information We Process

### 2.1 Content You Provide ("User Content")

Depending on what you choose to use, the App may process:

- **Audio recordings** you record in the App
- **Imported audio files** (e.g., MP3/M4A/WAV/AAC)
- **PDF files** you import

- Term explanations / expansions

### 2.3 Subscription / Purchase Information

If you purchase Premium:

### 2.4 Notifications

If you enable notifications, the App may schedule and display study reminders. Notifications may include **notebook names** and **flashcard question text** (study-only notifications; no marketing notifications).

### 2.5 Information We Do Not Use

Based on current implementation, the App does **not** use:

- Advertising networks
- Analytics SDKs (e.g., Firebase Analytics, Amplitude, Mixpanel)
- Crash reporting SDKs (e.g., Crashlytics, Sentry)

---

## 3. How We Use Information

We process information to:

- Provide core App functionality (create/manage notebooks, chapters, flashcards)
- Record/import audio and import PDFs
- Extract text from PDFs on device
- Provide AI features when you request them (transcription, learning plan generation, flashcards, term explanations)
- Manage Premium subscription access and restore purchases
- Send study reminders (only if you enable notifications)
- Provide support when you contact us

---

## 4. Where Your Data Is Stored

### 4.1 On Your Device (Primary Storage)

Your notebooks/chapters/flashcards and related content are stored locally on your device (including local files for audio/PDF as applicable).

### 4.2 Device Backups (Apple)

Depending on your iOS settings, your device may back up App data as part of **Apple iCloud device backups**. This is controlled by Apple and your device settings.

### 4.3 No Account / No Server Storage by Us

The App does not require sign-in, and **we do not store your study content on our own servers** as part of normal operation.

---

## 5. When Data Leaves Your Device (AI Processing)

When you use AI features, the App sends relevant content to a third-party AI provider (OpenAI API) to fulfill your request. This may include:

- Audio (or audio split into chunks for transcription)
- Transcripts
- Extracted PDF text
- Prompts/context needed to generate learning plans, flashcards, and explanations

**Important:** Do not upload or include sensitive personal information in recordings or documents (for example: health data, government IDs, bank details, passwords). AI outputs may be inaccurate and AI processing involves transmission to third parties.

Processing by third-party providers is subject to their terms and privacy practices. We do not control how third parties operate beyond what is necessary to call their APIs from the App.

---

## 6. Legal Bases for Processing (EU/GDPR)

If you are in the EU/EEA (including Bulgaria), we rely on:

- **Performance of a contract** (Article 6(1)(b)) — to provide the App features you request, including processing your content within the App
- **Consent** (Article 6(1)(a)) — for optional permissions such as notifications (and other cases where consent is required)
- **Legitimate interests** (Article 6(1)(f)) — basic app operations and preventing misuse, where applicable and balanced with your rights

---

## 7. Sharing of Information

We do not sell your personal data.

We may share data only as needed:

### 7.1 Service Providers

- **OpenAI (AI processing):** to generate transcriptions and study materials when you request AI features
- **RevenueCat (subscriptions):** to manage entitlements/subscription status
- **Apple (App Store / In-App Purchases):** for payment processing and subscription management

### 7.2 Legal Requirements

We may disclose information if required to comply with law, regulation, court order, or to protect rights, safety, and security.

---

## 8. Data Retention

- **On-device content:** retained until you delete it in the App or uninstall the App
- **AI/provider retention:** third-party retention depends on the provider's policies
- **Support emails:** if you email support, your email and message content will be retained as needed to respond and keep records

---

## 9. Your Choices and Controls

You can:

- **Delete individual notebooks/chapters/flashcards** within the App
- Use the App's **"delete all data / clear all data"** functionality (if enabled in the UI) to remove App data
- **Uninstall the App** to remove App-stored data from your device
- Disable **microphone** and **notifications** permissions in iOS Settings

---

## 10. Your Rights (EU/EEA)

If GDPR applies to you, you may have rights including:

- Access, rectification, deletion
- Restriction and objection
- Data portability
- Withdraw consent (where processing is based on consent)

Because most data is stored locally, you can usually exercise deletion by deleting content in-app or uninstalling the App. For requests or questions, contact: **ndimitrov992@gmail.com**.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Bulgarian supervisory authority: the **Commission for Personal Data Protection (CPDP)**.

---

## 11. Children's Privacy (13+)

The App is intended for users **13+**. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has used the App and provided personal data, contact **ndimitrov992@gmail.com** and we will take appropriate steps.

---

## 12. Security

We use reasonable measures to help protect information. However, no system is perfectly secure. You are responsible for securing your device and any backups.

---

## 13. International Transfers

Third-party providers (e.g., AI and subscription services) may process data outside Bulgaria and possibly outside the EU/EEA. Where applicable, such transfers may rely on legal mechanisms used by those providers (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent safeguards).

---

## 14. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last Updated" date will reflect the latest version. Continued use of the App after updates means you accept the updated policy.

## Appendix — App Store "App Privacy" (Practical Mapping)

This is not legal advice, but a helpful mapping for Apple's questionnaire based on the App's current implementation.

### Likely Answers

- **Tracking:** **No** (no ads, no cross-app tracking, no analytics SDKs)
- **Data collected:** **Yes**, at least for:
  - **User Content** (audio, PDFs, text) *because it is transmitted to a third party (OpenAI) when AI features are used*
  - **Purchases** (subscription/purchase info via Apple/RevenueCat)
  - **Identifiers** (device/app identifiers used by RevenueCat are commonly involved)

### Purpose

- **User Content:** App functionality (AI transcription/generation)
- **Purchases/Identifiers:** App functionality (subscription management)

### Linked to User

Since the App has **no accounts**, much may be "not linked to identity," but Apple may still consider purchase/identifier data linked to a device/account. When in doubt, choose the more conservative option (linked).
